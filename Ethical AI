Scenario 1 
  - Gen AI system that develops personalised content recommendation for users seems to consistently recommend content that aligns with certain cultural and demographic biases 
  - To maintain transparency and fairness in the AI system, 
    - Conduct thorough bias assessment to understand key biases present in the training data and algorithms 
    - Use specialised tools or metrices to quantify the biases (e.g. Holistic AI library and IBM's Fairness 360)
    - Enhance diversity of training data by includiing broader range of cultural, demographic, and user behaviour data
    - Implement explainability features to provide users with insights into why specific recommendations were made 
    - Offer transparency by showing key factors and attributes influencing the recommendations 
    - Establish user feedback loop where users can report biased recommendations or provide feedback on content relevance
    - Regulary analyse feedback to improve system's fairness

Scenario 2
  - Chatbot developed occasionally generates responses that are inappropriate or offensive, leading to customer dissatisfaction
  - Ensure accountability in deployment of chatbot by
    - Conducting detailed analysis of inappropriate responses to identify patterns and root causes 
    - Determine whether issue stems from biased training data, algorithmic limitations, or other factors 
    - Implement mechanism to quickly identify and rectify inappropriate responses (e.g. by updating chatbot training data or fine-tuning the model)
    - Communicate openly with affected customers, acknowledge the issue and assure them of prompt corrective actions 

Scenario 3
  - GenAI that automatically generates product descriptions for e-commerce platform generates instances that contain inaccurate information. 
  - Enhance reliability of AI model by 
    - Implementing rigorous QA to evaluate accuracy of generated product descriptions 
    - Creating comprehensive testing dataset that covers wide range of products and scenarios to identify and address inaccuracies 
    - Ensure that AI model is trained on diverse and extensive dataset specific to the e-commerce domain 
    - Implementing iterative training approach to continuously update and improve model based on user feedback and evolving product data
