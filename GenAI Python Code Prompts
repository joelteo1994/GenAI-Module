GenAI Coding Automation example prompts 
  - Write a python code that (1) undos the max_normalisation of the CPU_frequency column, and (2) renormalises it to min-max
  - Write a python code that converts the values of the "Price" column of a dataframe df from usd to euros
  - Write a Python code to perform the following tasks.
      1. Convert a data frame df attribute "Screen", into indicator variables, saved as df1, with the naming convention "Screen_<unique value of the attribute>".
      2. Append df1 into the original data frame df.
      3. Drop the original attribute from the data frame df.
  - Write a Python code to normalize the content under the attribute "CPU_frequency" in a data frame df concerning its maximum value. 
      - Make changes to the original data, and do not create a new attribute.
  - Write a Python code to modify the contents under the following attributes of the data frame as required.
      1. Data under 'Screen_Size_cm' is assumed to be in centimeters. Convert this data into inches. Modify the name of the attribute to 'Screen_Size_inch'.
      2. Data under 'Weight_kg' is assumed to be in kilograms. Convert this data into pounds. Modify the name of the attribute to 'Weight_pounds'.
  - write a python code to change the data type of the attributes "Screen_Size_cm" and "Weight_kg" of a dataframe to float
  - write a python code to replace the missing values in a pandas dataframe per the following guidelines 
      1. for categorical attribute "Screen_Size_cm", replace missing values with the most frequent value in the column 
      2. for continuous value attribute "Weight_kg", replace missing values with the mean value of the entries in the column
  - write a python code that identifies the columns with missing values in a pandas dataframe

GenAI EDA and Model Building example prompts 
  - Write a python code to perform the following actions.
    1. Import a data set from a CSV file, The headers for the data set must be in the first row of the CSV file.
    2. Generate the statistical description of all the features used in the data set. Include "object" data types as well.
  - Write a Python code to perform the following actions.
    1. Create regression plots for the attributes "CPU_frequency", "Screen_Size_inch" and "Weight_pounds" against "Price".
    2. Create box plots for the attributes "Category", "GPU", "OS", "CPU_core", "RAM_GB" and "Storage_GB_SSD" against the attribute "Price".
  - Write a Python code for the following.
    1. Evaluate the correlation value, pearson coefficient and p-values for all numerical attributes against the target attribute "Price".
    2. Don't include the values evaluated for target variable against itself.
    3. Print these values as a part of a single dataframe against each individual attribute.
  - Write a python code that performs the following actions.
    1. Group the attributes "GPU", "CPU_core" and "Price", as available in a dataframe df
    2. Create a pivot table for this group, assuming the target variable to be 'Price' and aggregation function as mean
    3. Plot a pcolor plot for this pivot table.
