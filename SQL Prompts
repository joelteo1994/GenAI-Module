1. Specify prompt instructions
  We have a Heart Disease prediction dataset with a single table which has the following attributes.
  1. age - age in years
  2. gender- gender (1 = male; 0 = female)
  3. cp - chest pain type
          -- Value 1: typical angina
          -- Value 2: atypical angina
          -- Value 3: non-anginal pain
          -- Value 4: asymptomatic
  4. trestbps - resting blood pressure (in mm Hg on admission to the hospital)
  5. chol - serum cholestoral in mg/dl
  6. fbs - (fasting blood sugar > 120 mg/dl)  (1 = true; 0 = false)
  7. restecg - resting electrocardiographic results
          -- Value 0: normal
          -- Value 1: having ST-T wave abnormality (T wave inversions and/or ST elevation or depression of > 0.05 mV)
          -- Value 2: showing probable or definite left ventricular hypertrophy by Estes' criteria
  8. thalach - maximum heart rate achieved
  9. exang - exercise induced angina (1 = yes; 0 = no)
  10. oldpeak - ST depression induced by exercise relative to rest
  11. slope - the slope of the peak exercise ST segment
          -- Value 1: upsloping
          -- Value 2: flat
          -- Value 3: downsloping
  12. ca - number of major vessels (0-3) colored by flourosopy
  13. thal - 3 = normal; 6 = fixed defect; 7 = reversable defect
  14. num (the predicted attribute) - diagnosis of heart disease (angiographic disease status)
          -- Value 0: < 50% diameter narrowing
          -- Value 1: > 50% diameter narrowing

2. Then, start with prompts 
  - Write an SQL query to find the minimum, maximum, and average age of patients in the dataset.
  - Write and SQL query to count the number of male and female patients in the dataset.
  - Write an SQL query to determine the frequency of each type of chest pain (typical angina, atypical angina, non-anginal pain, asymptomatic) among patients."
  - Write an SQL query to investigate the distribution of the target variable (presence or absence of heart disease) within different age groups (e.g., 20-30, 30-40, etc.).
